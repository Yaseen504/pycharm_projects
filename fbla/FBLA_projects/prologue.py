    Jerry: Joy, I don't get the concept of that at all.
    Every day just feels the exact same.
    I go to school, sit alone at lunch with no one, and watch TV.
    I feel like I'm drowning in a lake of dullness.
    Void of color, like the sky on a foggy day.
    My life is like, a dandelion, wishing to slowly dwindle away.
    The only thing I want is for this aching pain to go away."""
